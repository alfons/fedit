# File Management with Tauri 2.0 Using Rust
When using **Tauri 2.0**, for security reasons, the app does not have access to files but requires the use of its `fs` API or Rust's `std::fs` module. I have struggled to get the `fs` API to work so this project is meant to explore.

[Read this blog post](https://quentinwach.com/blog/2024/11/26/files-in-tauri-v2.html) for more details about this code and understand how to get file-manegement in Tauri 2.0 working.
